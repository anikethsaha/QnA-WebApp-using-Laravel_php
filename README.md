## How to Install
 1. I am using the laravel version `Laravel Framework 5.5.13` but the latest version may vary so my recommendation is to use this version     to create a laravel project using `composer create-project laravel/laravel app "5.5.*"` or if you want to work on the latest version       go on with `composer create-project laravel/laravel app ` it will create the new version
 2. clone or download the project file in your destination folder
 3. in you project file **replace all the folders and file except** for **vendor** folder which should be remain as it is after creating        the project. Replace all folders and files in your project directory
 4. I am using `mysql` database whose sql codes for creating the table is given in the repositpry by name **name.sql**.Please import that     file your phpmyadmin or any other software you are using to manage the database . **Note** : *the Database name is "name" only* 
 5. after this steps run `php artisan serve` in your project root directory and go to `http://localhost:8000/` make sure you have a mysql     server running (like Xampp or Wampp ) in back to load the contents
